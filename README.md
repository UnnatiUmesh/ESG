What is ESG Investing?

ESG stands for Environmental, Social, and Governance, which are key factors used to evaluate a company’s sustainability and impact. ESG investing means putting money into companies that perform well in these three categories:

•	Environmental: How a company deals with climate change, pollution, and resource use.

•	Social: How it treats employees, diversity, and human rights.

•	Governance: Leadership ethics, executive pay, and transparency.

Why ESG Matters

Research shows that companies with higher ESG scores often perform better financially. A study by Harvard Law School revealed:

•	Higher Profitability: Companies with high ESG scores are more profitable and less risky.

•	Better Capital Allocation: They make smarter financial decisions.

•	Stronger Growth: High ESG companies have higher valuations, larger size, and better returns.

•	Additionally, 90% of S&P 500 companies now publish annual sustainability reports to highlight their ESG efforts. These reports vary in length and format but provide insights for investors.


The Challenge of Greenwashing

Greenwashing is when companies exaggerate their ESG efforts to look more sustainable than they really are. This makes it harder for analysts to trust self-reported data. To avoid greenwashing, analysts rely on multiple sources to verify claims and ensure accurate assessments.

Current Challenges in ESG Scoring

Scoring ESG performance is a manual and time-consuming process:

•	Analysts collect data from various reports and sources.

•	ESG scores need regular updates, but the process isn’t fast enough for real-time updates.

•	With thousands of companies, the current system doesn’t scale well.
